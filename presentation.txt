Title: Cloud-Based Infrastructure Setup and Python Application Deployment
Subtitle: Utilizing AWS Services, Terraform, Docker, and Jenkins

Slide 2: Project Overview

Objective:
Set up a foundational cloud-based infrastructure for a hypothetical application.
Provision cloud storage, a message queue, and containerization infrastructure.
Implement a CI/CD strategy and ensure monitoring and security.
Dockerize and deploy a Python script in a containerized environment.
Tools and Technologies:
Infrastructure: AWS (S3, SQS, EKS), Terraform
CI/CD: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch
Security: IAM Roles, Security Groups, Network Policies


Slide 3: Infrastructure Setup Using IaC (Terraform)

Cloud Storage (S3 Bucket):
Provisioned an S3 bucket for storing application data using Terraform.
Ensured private access control for data security.
Message Queue (AWS SQS):
Set up an SQS queue to enable asynchronous communication between application components.
Containerization Infrastructure (EKS Cluster):
Deployed an Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform.
Configured networking (VPC, subnets) and IAM roles for secure access.
Integrated AWS Load Balancer Controller for managing ingress traffic.


Slide 4: Python Script in a Container

Objective:
Dockerize the provided Python script and deploy it in a containerized environment.
Python Script Functionality:
Receives HTTP POST requests via a Flask web service.
Logs request data to an S3 bucket.
Optionally sends the data to an SQS queue.
Dockerization:
Created a Dockerfile to build a container image for the Python script.
The container is configured to run the Flask application and interact with AWS services.


Slide 5: CI/CD Strategy

Infrastructure Management:
Jenkins pipeline to automate Terraform tasks: validate, plan, and apply changes.
Application Deployment:
Jenkins pipeline stages for building, testing, and deploying the Dockerized Python application.
Docker images are built and tested in Jenkins, then deployed to EKS using Helm.
Pipeline Details:
Stages: Validate Terraform, Plan Terraform, Apply Terraform, Build Docker Image, Deploy to Kubernetes.
Triggers: Automatic builds and deployments on code commits to the repository.


Slide 6: Monitoring and Security

Monitoring Tools:
Prometheus: Monitors the health and performance of the EKS cluster.
Grafana: Provides dashboards for visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus.
AWS CloudWatch: Centralized logging and monitoring for S3, SQS, and other AWS services.
Security Measures:
IAM Roles: Implemented least privilege access for AWS resources.
Security Groups: Restricted network traffic to and from the EKS cluster.
Kubernetes Network Policies: Controlled inter-pod communication within the cluster.
Data Encryption: Used AWS KMS for encrypting data at rest and in transit.


Slide 7: Project Outcomes

Infrastructure Provisioning:
Successfully provisioned all required cloud resources using Terraform.
Application Deployment:
Dockerized and deployed the Python application in the EKS cluster.
Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline for managing infrastructure and application code changes.
Monitoring and Security:
Set up comprehensive monitoring and security measures to ensure the reliability and integrity of the infrastructure.


Slide 8: Challenges and Solutions

Challenge 1: Integrating Terraform with Jenkins
Solution: Used Terraform plugins and scripts to automate infrastructure provisioning.
Challenge 2: Ensuring Secure Communication
Solution: Implemented IAM policies, security groups, and network policies to secure data and network traffic.
Challenge 3: Monitoring Distributed Systems
Solution: Deployed Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting.
